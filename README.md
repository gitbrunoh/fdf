## FDF (Modèle en fil de fer)

FDF is short for ’fil de fer’ in French which means ’wireframe model’.  

### **Summary**:  
This project is about representing a landscape as a 3D object in which all surfaces are outlined in lines.  

This project gave us our first steps on the X-Window C programming journey. To do this, we used a customised mini-library based on X-Window.

### Usage:
After the git clone of the repository:  

```make bonus```  

```./fdf_bonus test_maps/<choose a map>```  

When the programme is running you can use the following keys:

**←↑→↓** Use the arrows to move the model    
**`i`** for ZOOM IN and **`o`** for ZOOM OUT  
**`x`** Rotate around the X axis  
**`y`** Rotate around the Y axis  
**`d`** Back to default angle    
**`t`** top view  
**`r`** return to isometric view   
**`s`** Screetch  
**`a`** Flaten
